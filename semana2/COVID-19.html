                <h2>Protect yourself from COVID-19</h>
                    <h3>The World Health Organization has issued several recommendations to protect yourself:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash your hands frequently: Regularly and thoroughly wash your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water.</li>
                        <li>Maintain social distancing: Maintain at least 1-meter distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                        <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth: Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose, or mouth and then enter the body.</li>
                        <li>Respiratory hygiene: Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
                        <li>Medical attention: Seek medical attention early if you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Stay home if you feel sick.</li>
                    </ol>
